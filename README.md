# Meal Planner 2.0

This is a side project I've been working on for my wife. Intended to help with decision-making when it comes to meal planning, and implement paperless tracking of our meals.

Note: This app is currently designed for my family's personal use only. Feel free to check it out, but currently there is no option to personalize the meals in the database!

## Current Features 
1. View all the meals in the database
2. Return a meal plan. Select the number of meals you want to return (1-31) to get a list of random meals and the estimated grocery bill for the meal plan.
3. Find new recipes. Enter a search term to search for new recipes. This feature uses a 3rd party API.

# Tech Used
1. HTML5
2. Sass
3. JavaScript
4. jQuery
5. Vue.js
6. Node.js
7. Express.js
8. MySQL
